# Duplink

Collection of scripts to deduplicate files using hard-links

Includes script do automatically dedup files in NTFS volumes

## Prerequisites

python 3.6 
ntfs-3g

## Running


Generate a list of possible deduplications in a target folder, comparing files with a source folder:
```
    python genlist.py [source] [target]
```

Generate a list of possible deduplications inside a single folder:

```
    python genlist.py [folder]
```

Remove duplicate files and substitute with hard-links, based on a link list generated by genlist.py:

```
    python linkfiles.py [listfile]
```

Shell script to automate mount, list generation and deduplication of folders in NTFS volumes:

```
    ./ntfs_dedup.sh [device] [mountpoint] [source] [[target]]
```

The ntfs_dedup.sh script was specially designed to use with OpenBSD 6.x, using both native ntfs r/o
driver and ntfs-3g to handle correct inode numbers.
